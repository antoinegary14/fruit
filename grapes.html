  <b> Grapes </b>
</h>
<p>
Now don't get me started on grapes. <b> GRAPES</b> man are something else easy S tier before discussion I mean like have you ever eaten a grape cause then I know you would easily agree
</p>
<p>
Before we even talk about the taste we need to talk about the convience factor grapes are very easy to manage and the portability is endless they do lose some points due to the vine however, they gain it back instantly because the vine can in some cases double the viablity of grapes. Instead of having a bunch of seperated grapes you can pluch them from the vine and manage them with ease and if you want to just take off a bunch to save for later it's super quick making them one of the easiest and most portable fruit
</p>
<p> Now let's talk the taste, the god damn <b> taste</b> Grapes are just godlike in anyform they come in like the purple ones are so good but then the sour ones are good too and guess what even when that grape is all done a dried up boom you got rasians or if you wait eveeeeeen loner you get <em> Wine </em> </p>
